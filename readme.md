# Alessio
Alessio is an italian word for ```defender``` and is a blockchain project work in progress . this blockchain has a specific focus which has to do with its integration in video and audio streaming technologies, so this would work in a way that for every game streams completed, the gamer earns some alessio tokens of which part of it is gotten or derived from viewers. which means that every stream must have at least 2 viewers. Now this is a rough patch of how i see things now, and this is most likely to change.
